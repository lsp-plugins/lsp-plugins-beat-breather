<p>This plugin allows to drive much more dynamics into punchy sounds like drums and make them breathe again.</p>
<p>The plugin detects punchy sounds and adds more dynamics to them. This is acieved by applying multi-stage processing:</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Frequency split</b> - at this stage the whole frequency range becomes split into individual bands. To make sound
	much cleaner, the linear phase crossover is applied which adds some latency but provides several benefits:
	</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Unlike classic crossovers which use IIR (Infinite Impulse Response) filters to split signal into multiple bands and shift the phase
		of the audio signal at band split points, the <b>Linear Phase</b> allows to use FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filters which are deprived of this.
		<li>Unlike most IIR filters which are designed using bilinear transform, linear phase filters allow simulate their tranfer function
		to look like the transfer function of analog filters, without deforming it's magnitude envelope near the nyquist frequency.</li>
		<li>Unlike design of classic Linkwitz-Riley filters, the design of IIR filters provides shorter transition zone of the filter.</li>
		<li>Unlike classic IIR filters the slope of the FIR filter is not restricted to be the multiple of 6 dB.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Punch detection</b> - detection of peaks above the average level of the audio. For that case two type of RMS values are computed:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Long time</b> - the long-time RMS value (by default, the esimation period is 400 ms) to estimate the average level of the audio signal.</li> 
		<li><b>Short time</b> - the short-time RMS value (by default, the estimation period is less than 20 ms and depends on the frequency range) to estimate the envelope of the changing in time signal.</li>
	</ul>
	<li><b>Punch filtering</b> - additional stage to eliminate some noise from the signal not associated with punches.</li>
	<li><b>Beat processing</b> - short-time dynamic amplification of the frequency band accoding to the signal passed from the punch filter.</li>
</ul>
